# Abstract
This project focuses on the classification of iris flowers into their respective species by using the K-Nearest Neighbors machine-learning algorithm. The three species in this classification problem include setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The explanatory variables include sepal length, sepal width, pedal length, petal width. See sepal wiki. See petal wiki. We are essentially trying to predict the species of the iris flower based on physical features!

The K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm is interesting because it is a simple yet powerful a machine learning method used for classification. It predicts based on majority votes, measuring a certain number of neighboring observation points (k) and classifies based on attribute prevalence using Euclidean distance.
